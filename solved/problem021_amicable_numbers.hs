-- Problem 21: Amicable numbers
-- (Published on Friday, 5th July 2002, 06:00 pm; Solved by 77726)
--
--     Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers
--   less than n which divide evenly into n).
--
-- If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable
--   pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
--
--     For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11,
--   20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors
--   of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
--
--     Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
