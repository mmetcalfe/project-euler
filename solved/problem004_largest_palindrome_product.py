# Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
# (Published on Friday, 16th November 2001, 06:00 pm; Solved by 178192)
# 
#     A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest
# 	palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 =
# 	91 Ã— 99.
# 
#     Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit
# 	numbers.
