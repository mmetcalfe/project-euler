-- Problem 42: Coded triangle numbers
-- (Published on Friday, 25th April 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 42383)
-- 
--     The n^{th} term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
-- 	t_{n} = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
-- 
--     1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
-- 
--     By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to
-- 	its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word
-- 	value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 =
-- 	t_{10}. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call
-- 	the word a triangle word.
-- 
--     Using [words.txt](project/resources/p042_words.txt) (right click
-- 	and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly
-- 	two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

-- "A","ABILITY","ABLE","ABOUT","ABOVE"
