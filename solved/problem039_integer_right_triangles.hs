-- Problem 39: Integer right triangles
-- (Published on Friday, 14th March 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 39835)
-- 
--     If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral
-- 	length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p =
-- 	120.
-- 
--     {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
-- 
--     For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions
-- 	maximised?
