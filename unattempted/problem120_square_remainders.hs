-- Problem 120: Square remainders
-- (Published on Friday, 21st April 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 8143)
-- 
--     Let r be the remainder when (a−1)^{n} + (a+1)^{n} is divided by
-- 	a^{2}.
-- 
--     For example, if a = 7 and n = 3, then r = 42: 6^{3} + 8^{3} =
-- 	728 ≡ 42 mod 49. And as n varies, so too will r, but for a = 7 it
-- 	turns out that r_{max} = 42.
-- 
--     For 3 ≤ a ≤ 1000, find ∑ r_{max}.
