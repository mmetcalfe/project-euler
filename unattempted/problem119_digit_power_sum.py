# Problem 119: Digit power sum
# (Published on Friday, 7th April 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 5881)
# 
#     The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of
# 	its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8^{3} = 512.
# 	Another example of a number with this property is 614656 = 28^{4}.
# 
#     We shall define a_{n} to be the nth term of this sequence and
# 	insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a
# 	sum.
# 
#     You are given that a_{2} = 512 and a_{10} = 614656.
# 
#     Find a_{30}.
