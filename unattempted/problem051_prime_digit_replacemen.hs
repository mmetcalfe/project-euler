# Problem 51: Prime digit replacements
# (Published on Friday, 29th August 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 14107)
# <p>By replacing the 1<sup>st</sup> digit of *57, it turns out that
# 	six of the possible values: 157, 257, 457, 557, 757, and 857, are
# 	all prime.</p>
#     By replacing the 1^{st} digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns
# 	out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and
# 	83, are all prime.
# 
#     By replacing the 3^{rd} and 4^{th} digits of 56**3 with the same
# 	digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes
# 	among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113,
# 	56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being
# 	the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this
# 	property.
# 
#     Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number
# 	(not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of
# 	an eight prime value family.
