-- Problem 168: Number Rotations
-- (Published on Friday, 16th November 2007, 05:00 pm; Solved by 1542)
-- 
--     Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by
-- 	moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.
-- 
-- It can be verified that 714285=5Ã—142857.
-- 
-- This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of
-- 	its right-rotation.
-- 
--     Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 < n <
-- 	10^{100}, that have this property.
