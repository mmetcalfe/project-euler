# (Published on Friday, 10th September 2004, 06:00 pm; Solved by 7460)
# 
#     Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins
# 	can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can separated
# 	into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.
# 
#           OOOOO
#     OOOO   O
#     OOO   OO
#     OOO   O   O
#     OO   OO   O
#     OO   O   O   O
#     O   O   O   O   O
# 
# 
#     Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one
# 	million.
