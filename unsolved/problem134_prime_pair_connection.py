# Problem 134: Prime pair connection
# (Published on Friday, 15th December 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 3413)
# 
#     Consider the consecutive primes p_{1} = 19 and p_{2} = 23. It
# 	can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last
# 	digits are formed by p_{1} whilst also being divisible by p_{2}.
# 
#     In fact, with the exception of p_{1} = 3 and p_{2} = 5, for
# 	every pair of consecutive primes, p_{2} > p_{1}, there exist values
# 	of n for which the last digits are formed by p_{1} and n is
# 	divisible by p_{2}. Let S be the smallest of these values of n.
# 
#     Find ∑ S for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ p_{1} ≤
# 	1000000.
