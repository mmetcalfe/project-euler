# Problem 123: Prime square remainders
# (Published on Friday, 16th June 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 5909)
# 
#     Let p_{n} be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be
# 	the remainder when (p_{n}−1)^{n} + (p_{n}+1)^{n} is divided by
# 	p_{n}^{2}.
# 
#     For example, when n = 3, p_{3} = 5, and 4^{3} + 6^{3} = 280 ≡ 5
# 	mod 25.
# 
#     The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds
# 	10^{9} is 7037.
# 
#     Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds
# 	10^{10}.
