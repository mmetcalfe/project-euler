# Problem 91: Right triangles with integer coordinates
# (Published on Friday, 18th March 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 7237)
# 
#     The points P (x_{1}, y_{1}) and Q (x_{2}, y_{2}) are plotted at
# 	integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form
# 	ΔOPQ.

# 
#     There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle
# 	that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2
# 	inclusive; that is,
# 0 ≤ x_{1}, y_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2} ≤ 2.
#

# 
#     Given that 0 ≤ x_{1}, y_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2} ≤ 50, how many right
# 	triangles can be formed?
