# (Published on Friday, 31st January 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 42507)
# 
#     The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001_{2} (binary), is
# 	palindromic in both bases.
# 
#     Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are
# 	palindromic in base 10 and base 2.
# 
#     (Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may
# 	not include leading zeros.)
