-- Problem 6: Sum square difference
-- (Published on Friday, 14th December 2001, 06:00 pm; Solved by 194702)
--
--     The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
-- 1^{2} + 2^{2} + ... + 10^{2} = 385
--     The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
-- (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^{2} = 55^{2} = 3025
--     Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
-- 	ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
--
--     Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
-- 	one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

-- n = 100
-- nums = range(n + 1)
-- sum_squares = sum([k ** 2 for k in nums])
-- squared_sum = sum([k for k in nums]) ** 2
-- print('Sum of squares:', sum_squares)
-- print('Square of sum:', squared_sum)
-- print('Difference:', squared_sum - sum_squares)
