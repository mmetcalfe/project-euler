-- Problem 53: Combinatoric selections
-- (Published on Friday, 26th September 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 33935)
-- 
--     There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
-- 
--     123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
-- 
--     In combinatorics, we use the notation, ^{5}C_{3} = 10.
-- 
--     In general,
-- 
--         ^{n}C_{r} =     n!
-- r!(n−r)!    ,where r ≤ n, n! = n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0! = 1.
-- 
-- 
--     It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million:
-- 	^{23}C_{10} = 1144066.
-- 
--     How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  ^{n}C_{r}, for 1
-- 	≤ n ≤ 100, are greater than one-million?
