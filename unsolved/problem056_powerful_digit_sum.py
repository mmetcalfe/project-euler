# Problem 56: Powerful digit sum
# (Published on Friday, 7th November 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 27864)
# 
#     A googol (10^{100}) is a massive number: one followed by one-
# 	hundred zeros; 100^{100} is almost unimaginably large: one followed
# 	by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in
# 	each number is only 1.
# 
#     Considering natural numbers of the form, a^{b}, where a, b <
# 	100, what is the maximum digital sum?
